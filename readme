Backend (ASP.NET Core - Visual Studio 2022)
---------------------------------------------
- Open the cloned folder using Visual Studio 2022.
- Once open, click on the solution file named TodoApp.sln.
- The user may need to migrate and update the database.
- If required, open Package Manager Console in Visual Studio and type:
Update-Database
- If the database still doesnt work:
- Open SQLiteStudio (or similar)
- Import the database file from TodoApp.API/todos.db
- Once setup is okay, press F5 in Visual Studio 2022 to run the backend.
- The Swagger UI should open (e.g., https://localhost:7077/swagger).

 Frontend (React App)
------------------------
- No need to use Visual Studio for this.
- Open Command Prompt (or terminal).
- Navigate to the React frontend folder:
cd todo-ui
- Run the following to install dependencies:
npm install
- Once done, start the app by typing:
npm start
If everything runs fine:
- Backend API runs at: https://localhost:7077
- Frontend runs at: http://localhost:3000
Both should be working together.
